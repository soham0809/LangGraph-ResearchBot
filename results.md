# Research: What are recent advances in quantum computing?

Based on the search results, here are the key findings about unknown query:

1. Quantum computing has seen significant advances in quantum error correction, making quantum systems more reliable.

2. There have been breakthroughs in scaling quantum bits (qubits), with companies like IBM and Google achieving new milestones in qubit count and quality.

3. Quantum advantage demonstrations have shown quantum computers solving specific problems faster than classical supercomputers.

4. New quantum algorithms have been developed for optimization, machine learning, and simulation applications.

5. Quantum computing is being increasingly applied to real-world problems in chemistry, materials science, and finance.

These advances suggest quantum computing is moving from purely theoretical research toward practical applications, though widespread commercial use is still years away.
